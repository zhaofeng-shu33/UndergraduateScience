In Mathematica,it is ofen needed to change the free variable x to a new one,x=g(t) and get the differential (dy(x))/dx about the new variable t.
->(dy(g(t)))/dt dt/dx=(dy(g(t)))/dt g^-1 Subscript[(x), |x=g(t)].
We can assume y is about t and changes it to x then in Mathematica, we onlu need to resort to D[y[g^-1 (x)],x]/.x->g(t),which gives the same result by the invariance of differential.
